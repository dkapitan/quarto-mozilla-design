> _As a data scientist, AI expert, architect, advisor, lecturer and mentor, I help people and organizations master data and AI in different roles, ultimately to create sustainable change with digital technologies._

Dr. Daniel Kapitan (1973) is a well-rounded data scientist and strategic advisor with years of experience in the field of data, machine learning and digital transformation. His knowledge can help companies to identify how to use AI, and how to integrate this into business processes, roles, and day-to-day operations. He aims to create sustainable change in organizations by systematically engineering data that is required for new AI applications.

With a PhD in physics from University of Oxford and currently Fellow at the Eindhoven AI Systems Institute (EAISI), Daniel has a strong scientific grounding in the field. He speaks authoritatively about data-driven transformation programs, reducing complexity to ‘informed simplicity’ for even the most challenging data projects. By combining data and AI know-how with industry expertise, he is capable of bringing about end-to-end business transformation for mid-sized companies, government organizations and scale-ups.

Daniel starts when organizations are ready to embark on their digital journey, and finishes when people are enabled to continue to work with data and AI by themselves.

## Roles that I fulfill
Daniel works as an advisor, architect, lecturer, applied researcher and mentor. He is one of the few specialists in the Netherlands who has the unique combination of corporate experience, scientific research and executive education. Through these various roles he aims to apply ‘AI for good’. He lectures on data and AI, publishes regularly and is an active member of the Data Sharing Coalition to foster data solidarity and secure data sharing for tackling societal issues.

## Areas of expertise
